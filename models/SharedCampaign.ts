* Campaign is generated by the 10DLC registry once the corresponding campaign request is approved. Each campaign is assigned a unique identifier - **campaignId**.

When a campaign is suspended(reversible) or expired(non-reversible), campaign data is deleted from the OSR service. Most attributes of campaignare immutable, including **usecase**, **vertical**, **brandId** and **cspId**.
